# liriHw

LIRI will search Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies.


liri.js can take in one of the following commands:

   * `concert-this`

   * `spotify-this-song`

   * `movie-this`

   * `do-what-it-says`


Ex:  `node liri.js concert-this <artist/band name here>`
   * This will search the Bands in Town Artist Events API (`"https://rest.bandsintown.com/artists/" + artist + "/events?app_id=codingbootcamp"`) for an artist and render the following information about each event to the terminal:

     * Name of the venue

     * Venue location

     * Date of the Event (uses moment to format this as "MM/DD/YYYY")

Ex:  `node liri.js spotify-this-song '<song name here>'`
     * Artist(s)

     * The song's name

     * A preview link of the song from Spotify

     * The album that the song is from

   * If no song is provided then your program will default to "The Sign" by Ace of Base.

   * You will utilize the [node-spotify-api](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-spotify-api) package in order to retrieve song information from the Spotify API.

   * The Spotify API requires you sign up as a developer to generate the necessary credentials. Such as a **client id** and **client secret**:

Ex:  `node liri.js movie-this '<movie name here>'`
* This will output the following information to your terminal/bash window:

     ```
       * Title of the movie.
       * Year the movie came out.
       * IMDB Rating of the movie.
       * Rotten Tomatoes Rating of the movie.
       * Country where the movie was produced.
       * Language of the movie.
       * Plot of the movie.
       * Actors in the movie.
     ```

   * If the user doesn't type a movie in, the program will output data for the movie 'Mr. Nobody.'

Ex:  `node liri.js do-what-it-says`
   
   * Using the `fs` Node package, LIRI will take the text inside of random.txt and then use it to call one of LIRI's commands.

   * It should run `spotify-this-song` for "I Want it That Way," as follows the text in `random.txt`.
